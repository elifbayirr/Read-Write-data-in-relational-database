# Read-Write-data-in-relational-database

This code (my java source file named "baglantı") is for communicating with mysql and reading/writing data. 
We need to import our deneme2.sql file into mysql.

For the connector;
In order to run our 'baglantı' code, I first create a folder named "library" and define the "mysql-connector-java-8.0.28" executable jar file in it. 
Then I create "dbase" package under my "src" file and write my java code in it.
